    "Notes:\n",
    "* Attention is a communication mechanism. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "* There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
    "* Each example across batch dimension is processed completely independently and never communicate with each other. \n",
    "* \"self-attention\" just means that they keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other external source (e.g. an encoder module).\n",
    "* \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `weight` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q, K are unit variance, `weight` will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much."
